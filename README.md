## Neural Machine Translation with RNNs
In Machine Translation, our goal is to convert a sentence from the source language (e.g. Mandarin Chi-
nese) to the target language (e.g. English). We implemented a sequence-to-sequence
(Seq2Seq) network with attention, to build a Neural Machine Translation (NMT) system, which uses a Bidirectional LSTM
Encoder and a Unidirectional LSTM Decoder.
